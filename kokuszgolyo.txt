Work Time: ?

Ingredients:
* 250g fine ground biscuit [1]
* 150g powdered sugar
* 100g butter (room temperature)
* 100ml milk
* 2 - 3 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1 tsp rum [2]
* Desecated coconut

Method:
1. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
2. Cut the butter into cubes
3. Mix the butter with the dry ingredients until well incorporated
4. Start adding the milk little by little until you have a wet dough that holds its shape
5. Add the rum and mix well
6. Form small balls rolling the dough between your palms
7. Roll in the coconut

Notes:
[1] Rich tea biscuits or Golya from HEB will work
[2] I tend to stick my thumb in the dough and fill the whole with rum, significantly more than the suggested 1 tsp
